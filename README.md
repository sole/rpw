> reinventing the presentation wheel

this is something I keep toying with after each presentation I make, so perhaps it's not such a silly idea after all.

right now it's hopelessly broken so I'd advice you don't even bother running it.

## getting it

### clone it

`git clone https://github.com/sole/rpw.git`

### or download

[the zip](https://github.com/sole/rpw/archive/master.zip)

## initialising

Install node.js if not installed yet, then cd to the directory and run `npm init`.

To build the files into the `build` folder just do `npm start`. This will start a gulp script and it will watch for changes in the src folder and rebuild. Open `build/index.html` to see your thing in action, or better yet serve it with a local server.

Now GO and create amazing stuff.

## TODO

- use jade
- use stylus? and that thing for autoprefixing
